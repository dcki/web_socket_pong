# Web Socket Pong

Work in progress.

## Ruby version

See the .ruby-version file.

## System dependencies

Recommend using Postgres.app for PostgreSQL.

Recommend brew installing some things.

Recommend rbenv with ruby-build.

gem install bundler

For some reason `bundle exec rails` is printing a bunch of 'already initialized constant' warnings. Use the bin stubs: `bin/rails`, `bin/rake`, etc.

Remember, if you're changing things and the behavior of the app doesn't change as you expect, and you're really confused, then you might want to try `bin/spring stop`.
